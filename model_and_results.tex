    Predicting the adoption curve of Helium Hotspotsusing the Bass Model (Bass, 1969).

\section{The Bass Model}

The \emph{Bass Model} was originated by Frank Bass in 1969 and is used to predict new product diffusion patterns. In his first paper
in 1969, Bass built on the findings of Rodgers (1963) on the \emph{Diffusion of Innovations} and introduced what he called a
\emph{new product growth model for consumer durables}. Later, this model proved to be applicable to more products than just consumer
durables, and eventually became worldwide known as the \emph{Bass Model}. The model is used to explain the interaction between current
and potential adopters of a new product. It states that there are two types of adopters - the innovators and the imitators. The speed
and timing of adoption depends on their degree of innovation and the degree of imitation among adopters. Accoding to Bass, these are the
two main kinds of forced determining the diffusion pattern.

\medskip

\noindent There are three key parameters in the Bass Model - usually called $p$, $q$, and $m$:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $p$ is called the \emph{coefficient of innovation} and represents the rate or probability that an innovator will adopt at time t. 
    \item $q$ is called the \emph{coefficient of imitation} and accounts for the “word of mouth” or “social contagion” effects.
    \item $m$ indicates the market size and provides the scale of the demand forecast. Unlike the other two parameters $p$ and $q$,
    $m$ does not determine the shape of the adoption curve. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The two parameters $p$, and $q$ specify how fast or slow the adoption of a new product is expected to proceed. To sum up, the adoption of a
new product can proceed either by small scale or a large scale (specified by $m$) or at a fast or slow pace (specified by $p$ and $q$). 
Figure 1 shows different estimated curves with various levels of innovation ($p$) and imitation ($q$). Characteristic of these diffusion curves is
their S-shape, which illustrates that the adoption rate of a new product is particularly low at the beginning, when no contagion effects can yet exist,
and at the end, when market saturation has been reached.

\noindent We derive the estimation function from the Bass equation below:

\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
    \begin{split}
        \frac{f(t)}{m - F(t)} = p + q * \frac{F(t)}{m}\\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where $F(t)$ is the installed base fraction, i.e. the number of current cumulative adoptions; $f(t)$ is the change of the installed base
fraction, i.e. the number of new adoptions in a specific timeframe; $p$ is the coefficient of innovation; and $q$ is the coefficient of imitation.
In order to estimate those parameters, an estimation funciton needs to be derived. Using some simple algebra we get:

\begin{equation} \label{eq2}
    \begin{split}
    f(t) & = \left[ p + \frac{q * F(t)}{m} \right] * (m - F(t)) \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq3}
    \begin{split}
    f(t) & = a + b * N(t) + c * \left[ N(t) \right]^2
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where we can derive that:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    a & = p*m \\[2pt]
    b & = q - p \\[2pt]
    c & = - \frac{q}{m} \\[15pt]
    m & = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2c} \\
    p & = \frac{a}{m} \\[2pt]
    q & = -m*c
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\bigskip

\noindent Using the estimation function from \emph{Equation 3}, a linear regression can be performed. The resulting parameters $a$, $b$ and $c$ can be
then used to calculate the coefficient of innovation $p$, the coefficient of imitation $q$ and the market size $m$ by applying the formulas from \emph{Equation 4}.

\section{Data Analysis and Results}

As a first step, we collect all hostpot adoptions from the Helium blockchain for New York City, US. We consider New York as an interesting study
environment since it is a comparatively fast adopting city. The installation date of a hotspot is stored in the blockchain by a daily frequency. However, to
avoid many zero entries in our dataset, especially at the beginning of the hotspot diffusion process, we decided to transform our dataset to a weekly frequency.
This allows us to observe the evolution of adoptions from week to week, as can be seen in Figure 2 (weekly adoptions) and Figure 3 (weekly cumulative adoptions).

\begin{figure}[!hptb]
    \begin{subfigure}[h]{0.52\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/weekly_hotspot_adoptions.png}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[h]{0.52\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/weekly_hotspot_adoptions_cumulative.png}
    \end{subfigure}%
    \caption{Number of weekly new adoptions (left) and weekly cumulative hotspot adoptions (right).}
    \end{figure}


\noindent Especially in Figure 2 (right), it can be clearly seen that the number of adoptions is still increasing rapidly and saturation has not been reached yet.
So it is very interesting to fit the Bass Model based on this data set to predict the next period. We examine the period from August 10, 2020 to November 7, 2021,
which corresponds to an observation period of 65 weeks. We then use the estimated Bass Model based on this period to predict the evolution of adoption numbers until
the end of 2022, more precisely until December 26, 2022.

\bigskip

\noindent The estimates of our analysis give us a coefficient of innovation $p$ of $0.00066$, a coefficient of imitation $q$ of $0.055$, and a market size $m$ of $9754$. If we
plot our fitted curve against actual weekly (new) hotspot adoptions as in Figure 3, we can see that the curve describes reality well.

\begin{figure}[!hptb]
    \centering{}\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{plots/bass_model_adoptions_vs_actual_adoptions.png}\\
    \caption{Fitted Bass Model (blue) vs. Actual Hotspots Adoptions (orange).}
\end{figure}

\noindent Figure 4 again shows, similar to Figure 3, our fitted curve, but this time against the weekly cumulative hotspot adoptions. Additionally, we inclueded the prediction
of our Bass Model until the end of 2022. It can be seen that, according to our prediction, the saturation will be reached at the beginning of 2023 at around $9700$ adoptions,
just as our estimated parameter $m$ suggested.

    \caption{Bass Model Estimation until the End of 2022 (blue) vs. Acutal Adoption until November 2021 (orange).}
\end{figure}

\noindent In a final step, we compare the Bass Model prediction with the real hotspots adoptions until December 2022. The result can be seen in Figure 5. It can be seen, that our
prediction is clearly too optimisitc and that the actual market saturation is reached at around $6000$ hotspots.
